# Password-Generator
*Project Description:*

The Password Generator is a robust and user-friendly tool designed to enhance online security by creating strong, randomized passwords. By allowing users to specify the number of letters, symbols, and numbers, this generator helps to produce unique passwords tailored to individual security needs.
